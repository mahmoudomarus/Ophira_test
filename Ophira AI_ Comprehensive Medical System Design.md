The system is designed to be personalized to each user's medical background, continuously learning and adapting to provide increasingly accurate and relevant health insights over time.

### Use Case Examples

**Use Case 1: User-Initiated Health Check**
```
User: "Hi, Ophira."
Agent: Hi, Sam, how are you doing today? 
User: I'm okay, just wanted to check if there's something wrong because I feel a little extra tired today? 
Agent: Let me check, Sam. I will do some checks on your health. Bear with me...
[Agent activates sensors and begins analysis while continuing conversation]
Agent: How did you sleep last night? Did you have breakfast today?
User: "I haven't gotten enough sleep last night, and I didn't have breakfast." Could that be a problem?
Agent: We're almost done with the checks, let me check the result and look at it.
Agent: From what I have gathered, I can see some swelling in your blood vessels. Your heart is doing alright, but your Systolic BP indicates that you haven't had enough sleep. I recommend you get some extra sleep and eat something nutritious [personalized food recommendations based on user's diet profile].
[Agent provides detailed report stored in memory]
User: Thanks, Ophira, let me know during the week if you notice something abnormal.
```

**Use Case 2: Emergency Alert**
```
Agent: Hi Sam, I can see that you haven't taken your Insulin and your glucose levels are dropping rapidly. You're at risk of hypoglycemia. Do you need assistance?
[If no response from user]
Agent: [Initiates emergency protocol based on user's preset instructions]
```
