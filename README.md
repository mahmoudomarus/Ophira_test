## 🔍 What's Working Now

1. **Agent Communication**: Full message passing system with routing
2. **Conversation Management**: Context-aware dialogue handling
3. **Intent Recognition**: Basic pattern matching for health queries
4. **Emergency Detection**: Priority escalation for critical situations
5. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging with medical event tracking
6. **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration management

## 🚧 Next Implementation Steps

### Immediate Next Tasks:

1. **Set up databases** - We need to decide on local vs cloud services
2. **Integrate medical models** - Research and implement actual medical AI models
3. **Create sensor simulators** - Generate realistic health data for testing
4. **Add specialist agents** - Implement medical analysis agents

### Questions for You:

1. **Which API keys do you have available?** (OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, etc.)
2. **Database preference?** (Local Docker containers vs Cloud services)
3. **GPU availability?** (For running medical models locally)
4. **Priority medical specialties?** (Which medical analyses to implement first)

## 🎭 Sample Interactions

The system currently handles:
- Greetings and conversation management
- Health check requests  
- Symptom reporting
- Emergency situation detection
- General health questions

**Example conversation:**
```
User: "Hello Ophira"
Ophira: "Hi User001, how are you feeling today?"

User: "How am I doing health-wise?"
Ophira: "Let me run some quick health checks for you. Please bear with me while I gather data from your sensors."
Ophira: "I've completed a basic health check. Everything appears to be within normal ranges."

User: "I have chest pain and can't breathe"
Ophira: "I'm detecting a potentially serious situation. Let me assess this immediately."
[Emergency protocols activated]
```
